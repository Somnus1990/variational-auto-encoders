# Variational Auto Encoders (VAE)

This is a report on the development of a VAE model and experiments performed on it to better understand its functionality and properties. The implementation and the main codes that was used to produce the figures in the report can be find [here](https://github.com/rezazzr/variational-auto-encoders/blob/master/iwae_vae.ipynb) and the report itself [here](https://github.com/rezazzr/variational-auto-encoders/blob/master/Experimenting_With_Variational_Auto_Encoders.pdf).<br>
<br>
The first 2 sections of the report are dedicated to the development of the model and the choices that came along with it. A general overview of the architecture is presented in section 1. Section 2 tries to demonstrate the different methods that could be used to increase the feature map size. The analysis presented in this section is both from a visual aspect and mathematical one.<br>
<br>
Section 3 explores the properties of VAE for a better understanding of its functionality and presents some analysis between the vanilla VAE and [IWAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00519). In section 4 the model presented in the report will be evaluated in a more quantitative setting for future comparisons.
